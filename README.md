## The Team

This project was completed between [Jacob Lubecki](https://gitlab.com/jacoblubecki), [Ian Chang](https://gitlab.com/enchang), [Tyler Chinn](https://gitlab.com/tchinn), [Guillermo Gallegos](https://gitlab.com/guillermoney003), [Zack Warnick](https://gitlab.com/ZackerWins).

## Description

In this project an internet database is created that follows a similar format as [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). The database has 3 kinds of pages or subjects that form the database. All 3 pages or subjects are connected and each item in the database belongs to 1 type of page or subject and has links to items in the other 2 subjects. 

The frontend of the site is implemented with JavaScript, the backend is implemented with Python and Flask, the database is implemented with SQLAlhemy and PostgreSQL, the website is hosted on GCP, and the GUI is implemented with Bootstrap.

The database for this group will be a Pokémon database. The 3 kinds of pages or subjects will be Pokémon, Pokémon Type, and Evolution Chain.
