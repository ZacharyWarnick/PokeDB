<h1>About</h1>
<p>In this website an internet database is created that follows a similar 
  format as IMDb. The database has 3 kinds of pages or subjects that form 
  the database. All 3 pages or subjects are connected and each item in the 
  database belongs to 1 type of page or subject and has links to items in 
  the other 2 subjects. The database for this group will be a Pokémon 
  database. The 3 kinds of pages or subjects will be Pokémon, Pokémon Type, 
  and Evolution Chain.</p>
