# Summary

(Describe loosely the feature scope which needs testing.)
(This issue should be completed alongside or before development on related issues.)

## Test Ideas

(List of 3+ ideas for test-cases. Does not need to be exhaustive.)
(Still, try to be comprehensive. More than 3 tests should be listed in most cases.)
(Sub-points should explain rationale for each test idea.)

## Related Issues

(List of related bug or feature issues and brief descriptions.)
(Example entry: Populate dynamic HTML for user page (#12))

(If this task is not assigned to the same person as those in the related issues,
then discuss with the users for the related issues or assign those issues to yourself.
If another user is handling an issue, then the two users should pair program if possible.)

## Uncovered

(Optionally -- describe any code which may be marked with `# pragma: no cover`).
(Code which is ignored by coverage should be justified in advance as much as possible.)

## Additional Info

(Optionally -- any other details that might be useful to describe testing.)
