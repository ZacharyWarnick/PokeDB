# Rationale

(Why should the feature be added?)

## User Story

(Required -- add a story to describe the user experience for the feature.)

## Specification

### Code

(A list of bullet points explaining how added HTML and CSS should behave.)

### Database

(List tables, models, etc. required for populating the UI.)

### Interface

(Explanation of user interface, possibly including pictures/diagrams.)
(Don't just re-summarize the user story. This should be more technical.)

## Usage

(Add info about how backend code should populate the UI.)

## Tests

(List ideas for how the UI can be tested.)
